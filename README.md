- 👋 Hi, I’m @L-tv
- 👀 I’m interested in learning the basics and start building my own opinions and preferences in regards of coding.
- 🌱 I’m currently taking my first steps, following yt tutorials and courses and I also joined a Samsung Developers Course, where I'm learning front-end development.
- 💞️ I'm not looking to collaborate with anyone right now, since I'm starting my career, and I feel underqualified to be useful in a project, but feel free to reach out if you don't care.
- 📫 How to reach me: you can e-mail me here = lidika@live.com
